# Horse Tales
### About
Horse Tales is a 2D pony JRPG that consists of a mixture of Sci-Fi and Medieval environment and it sets on the 26th century on your own world.
### Features
Horse tales comes with the *most* features planned so try to wait for it:
**Note: If there's a check, that means that this feature is in Alpha, otherwise, it isn't.**
[ ] Use the 5 races (Swordspony, Mage, Archer, Tanker, Assassin) with their advances, skills and abilities.
[ ] Explore the procedural world around you and find gold, go inside dungeons, kill monsters and ponies etc,
[ ] Play on a story in campaign mode as your character.
[ ] And more...

## NOTE: Do not think that this thing will work since you probably know that this is an unstable game/library.
