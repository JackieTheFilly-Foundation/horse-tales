# Changelogs

## What's new since pre-alpha 0.10a:
### Added:
* This file (CHANGELOGS.md)
* New file named entityexception_demonstration2.py because: when putting this bad boy to the htlib directory/library, Python thinks
htlib.basicinfo *isn't defined*. **__durr.__** I'll probably make a setup.py deployment soon, so don't you worry!
* Added Features and Navigation section on [README](README.md).

### Changes:
* Moved some examples on the [examples folder](htlib/examples) for a clearer space on the root directory
* Deleted generateworld.py from [htlib](htlib) library since there was no code and it doesn't have any purpose...yet.

### Fixes:
* Fixed a lot of bugs in [htlib.basicinfo](htlib/basicinfo.py) because the exceptions, leftover code, typos and mistakes.
